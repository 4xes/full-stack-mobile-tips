Here's some areas where most Senior Developers lack of basics despite many years of experience:
   - Networking (Protocols, API related HTTP Headers, Web-Socket) 
   - Bitwise Operators, http://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/go_bitwise_operators.htm
   - Regexp
   - Memory Allocation
   - Algorithmic thinking (Logic, Big O notation()
   - Linux (File IO, commands, performace, ...)

#### Networking 
We are all spending most of our time around APIs built by someone else.
Wouldn't be great to understand underline networking protocols HTTP/2, WebSockets, WebRTC, etc?

Ilya Grigorik, Google wrote a great book, High Performance Browser Networking:

Secure it! XSS, CSRF, CORS, JWT, etc

#### Algorithmic thinking and experience
* Algorithm Visualizer, http://jasonpark.me/AlgorithmVisualizer/#path=graph_search/dfs/tree
* Algorithms and Data Structures for Golang, https://github.com/0xAX/go-algorithms
* Algorithms and Data Structures in Python , https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsJ_X8XMWFjOfvMXk7HsZYr8vUwYVxTQM
* Algorithms (4th Edition) 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick, https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X

#### Linux 
Look at this! It was built by large community over the past 20 years and has a lot of great, well-optimized libraries. There is no need to reinvent everything in Golang.

Learn/refresh bash and basic shell commands first however
* Bash in Y minutes, https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/
* Shell commands explanation, http://explainshell.com/
* Linux Command Shell For Beginners http://vic.gedris.org/Manual-ShellIntro/1.2/ShellIntro.pdf

#### Regexp
Easy! Learn how to visualize it
![Regex](regex.png)

^\({0,1}((0|\+61)(2|4|3|7|8)){0,1}\){0,1}(\ |-){0,1}[0-9]{2}(\ |-){0,1}[0-9]{2}(\ |-){0,1}[0-9]{1}(\ |-){0,1}[0-9]{3}$
* RegExper, https://regexper.com/ Ex: https://goo.gl/tqNCSv
* Regex101, https://regex101.com/

#### Interview check-lists and recommended reading 
* An introduction to distributed systems, https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class
* Most Golang related interview shadows "50 Shades of Go" article.
Can you explain in plain English how Concurrency and Parallelism work in Go?`
http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/
* Do you know how to write High Performance Go?
http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/davecheney/presentations/writing-high-performance-go.slide#1
* How to Pass a Programming Interview (triplebyte.com)
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11246917


#### Codility and other online testing 
* Most HR expects you to score 200+ from 300 points. Practice, https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/  
* Tips for tasks on Codility, http://dev.tasubo.com/2012/09/tips-for-tasks-on-codility.html

DON'T SKIP TRAINING! You are compiting again other candidates. Good news - most candidates are too lazy, overconfident and 90% of them won't bother to spend 4-6 hours to practice.
